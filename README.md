## Digraphs
 A directed graph (or digraph) is a set of vertices and a collection of directed edges that each connects an ordered pair of vertices. We say that a directed edge points from the first vertex in the pair and points to the second vertex in the pair. We use the names 0 through V-1 for the vertices in a V-vertex graph.
 
The outdegree of a vertex is the number of edges pointing from it.

The indegree of a vertex is the number of edges pointing to it.

**When drawing a directed graph, the edges are typically drawn as arrows indicating the direction, as illustrated in the following figure.
