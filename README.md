# OOP_Ex3  - This task implements a data structure of a weighted and directed graph in Python, the implementation includes a class of graphs as well as a class of algorithms on graphs.

## Types of Graphs

Undirected: if for every pair of connected nodes, you can go from one node to the other in both directions.

Directed: if for every pair of connected nodes, you can only go from one node to another in a specific direction. We use arrows instead of simple lines to represent directed edges.


## Weighted and Directed graph
A weighted directed graph is represented as a list of (vertex-edgelist) pairs, where the pairs are in standard order , the edgelist is a list of (neighbor-weight) pair also in standard order, every weight is a nonnegative integer, and every neighbor appears as a vertex even if it has no neighbors itself." A common operation on weighted (directed) graphs is the shortest-path computation; the determination of the path(s) from two nodes A and B such that the sum of the weights of the vertices on the path is minimal


## What is a graph?
Graph is a structure amounting to a set of objects in which some pairs of the objects are in some sense "related". The objects correspond to mathematical abstractions called vertices (also called nodes or points) and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an edge (also called link or line). Typically, a graph is depicted in diagrammatic form as a set of dots or circles for the vertices, joined by lines or curves for the edges. The edges may be directed or undirected.


## Digraphs
 A directed graph (or digraph) is a set of vertices and a collection of directed edges that each connects an ordered pair of vertices. We say that a directed edge points from the first vertex in the pair and points to the second vertex in the pair.
 
The outdegree of a vertex is the number of edges pointing from it.

The indegree of a vertex is the number of edges pointing to it.

## Applications
Graphs are directly applicable to real-world scenarios. For example, we could use graphs to model a transportation network where nodes would represent facilities that send or receive products and edges would represent roads or paths that connect them (see below).

#### When drawing a directed graph, the edges are typically drawn as arrows indicating the direction, as illustrated in the following figure.
